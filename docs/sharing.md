Share your set of mathematical functions with others and control how they can interact with them.

## How to Share

1. Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) to open the command menu
2. Type "share" and select "Share"
3. Choose your restriction mode (see below)
4. Click "Create Share Link"
5. Copy and send the link to others

## What Gets Shared

When you create a share link, the **complete state** is saved:
- All your function definitions
- Current visibility of each function
- Current view position and zoom level as standard
- Any landmarks you've created

This means recipients see exactly what you see when you create the link.

## Restriction Modes

**None** - Full access
- Recipients can edit functions and change all settings
- Use for: Collaborative work, group projects

**Read Only** - View and explore only
- Recipients can navigate and hear functions but cannot edit them
- Can still zoom, move view, and create landmarks
- Use for: Sharing homework solutions, demonstrations

**Full Restriction** - Viewing only
- Recipients can only see and hear the exact functions you set up
- Cannot change anything
- Use for: Presentations, tests, controlled experiences

## Alternative Methods

**Export as file:**
1. Press `Ctrl+K` → "Export as file"
2. Choose restriction mode in settings
3. Save and share the JSON file

**Manual sharing:**
Simply tell others your function definitions to type in themselves.

## What Recipients See

When someone opens your shared link:
- Your functions load automatically
- Interface adapts based on restriction level
- Restricted features are hidden or disabled

*Tip: Always test your shared link before sending to ensure it works as expected.*
