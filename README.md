# Audiofunctions+

Audiofunctions+ is a web app designed to facilitate visually impaired students’ learning of mathematical functions. Audiofunctions+ allows users to interpret the shape of a function’s graph by listening to its sonification.  
Audiofunctions+ is one of the deliverables of the \[SONAIRGRAPH\](https://sonairgraph.unito.it/) Erasmus+ project.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Command | Action | Keyboard shortcut |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| show/hide menu | show menu to select a command | ctrl+K (cmd+K on Mac) |
| move cursor (stepwise) | move cursor horizontally (stepwise) | left and right arrows or J and L keys |
| move cursor (fluid) | move cursor horizontally (fluid) | shift+(left and right arrows or J and L keys) or mouse move |
| jump to left or right edge | move cursor to the left (minX) or right (maxX) edge of the view | ctrl+(left and right arrows) (cmd+arrow on Mac) |
| speed change | show menu to increase or decrease playing speed | M |
| step size change | show menu to increase or decrease step size | M |
| move view | move the displayed view up, left, down, or right | W A S D |
| zoom in/out (both axes) | zoom in/out in both axes | Z and shift+Z |
| zoom in/out (X axis) | zoom in/out only on the X axis (only minX and maxX change) | X+(Z or shift+Z) |
| zoom in/out (Y axis) | zoom in/out only on the Y axis (only minY and maxY change) | Y+(Z or shift+Z) |
| reset view to default | set the view position and zoom to its default value | R |
