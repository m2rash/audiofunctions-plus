# Welcome to Audiofunctions+

Audiofunctions+ is a web application that helps visually impaired students learn mathematical functions through sound. By converting function graphs into audio, you can explore and understand mathematical relationships through hearing.

## What You Can Do

- **Explore functions with sound**: Move through graphs and hear how functions change
- **Navigate easily**: Use simple keyboard shortcuts to control everything
- **Work with multiple functions**: Define and compare different mathematical expressions
- **Set landmarks**: Mark important points for quick navigation


## Getting Started

1. **Open command palette**: `Ctrl+K` (`Cmd+K` on Mac)
2. **Basic navigation**:
   - Move cursor: Arrow keys or `J`/`L`
   - Move view: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
   - Show coordinates: `C`
3. **Manage functions**:
   - New function: Press `F` and use function editor
   - Switch between functions: `N` or number keys `1`-`9`
4. **Audio controls**:
   - Sonification on/off: `P`
   - Play entire function: `B`
   - Switch sonification type: `I`

### Special Features

#### Advanced Navigation

Take full control of your navigation with these advanced movement options:

- **Fluid/stepwise movement**: `Shift+Arrow keys` for smooth movement
- **Zoom/Scale controls**: `Z` and `Shift+Z` to enlarge/shrink the view around its center
- **Axis-specific zooming/scaling**: `X+Z` and `Shift+X+Z` for X-axis, `Y+Z` and `Shift+Y+Z` for Y-axis
- **Center cursor**: `Ctrl+Z` to reorientate the view, that the cursor is in the center

- **Mouse movement with volume feedback**: Move your mouse across the graph to hear function values through volume changes - louder sounds indicate higher values, quieter sounds indicate lower values


#### Landmarks System

Create interactive markers at important points on your functions - landmarks help you quickly navigate to specific coordinates and understand key features of mathematical graphs:

- **Create/edit landmark**: `Ctrl+B` (`Cmd+B` on Mac) at desired position
- **Jump between landmarks**: `Ctrl+Arrow keys` or `J` and `L` (`Cmd+Arrow keys` on Mac)
- **Jump to specific landmark**: `Ctrl+Number key` (`Cmd+Number key` on Mac)

## Need Help?

**First time using Audiofunctions+?** Start by pressing `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) to open the command menu - it will guide you through available actions. You can also press `F1` at any time to open the help menu.


**Having issues or suggestions?** We'd love to hear from you! You can reach out to the development team or share your feedback to help us improve the application for everyone.
